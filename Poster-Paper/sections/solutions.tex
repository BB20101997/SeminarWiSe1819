\section{Solutions}
In this section I will present possible solution
for the individual Problems where possible.

\subsection{Vague Goals}
When a vague goal is encountered the best option is to reiterate this goal with the entity that has set this goal an let them specify what they meant. For our example where the options to increase Profitability where better advertisement or finding inefficiencies and removing them, these options could than be presented to the client so they can decide which to pursue.


\subsection{Moral acceptability}
If the Problem would be that the algorithm could be misused
this might be fixable, as one could try to eliminate or limit this possibility to a satisfiable degree.

\subsection{Economic incentive}
Depending on the algorithm the government can
give incentives to reduce the financial load
to produce algorithms beneficial to the public and
produce laws limiting the extend of e.g. privacy invading algorithms.
