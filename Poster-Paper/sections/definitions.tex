\subsection{A Problem}
A Problem is anything which may result in unwanted negative effects of any kind.

\subsection{The Phases of Development}
For the Phases of development this paper will assume the following five stages similar to those found in the Waterfall model.
In real world application these phases might occur in parallel or multiple times or not at all.

The first Phase of Development is the phase of discovering and evaluating the Projects requirements, usually these might be constrained by a customers wishes and budget.

The second Phase of Development is the planning Phase where based on the result of the first Phase will be decided on the general structure of the Project.

The third Phase of Development is the Phase of actually implementing the Projects Plan and requirements.

The fourth Phase is where we have a larger divergent from the waterfall model as this is the Phase where the Algorithm will be trained, this is not a phase found in typical software development.

The last Phase is the Phase of Usage and Maintenance where the Product will be applied in the world and needs to be maintained.
