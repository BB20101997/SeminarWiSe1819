\section{Introduction}

This paper to the poster attached in the appendix and will describe possible problems when applying deep-learning technologies and their possible effects. The problems will be grouped based on the development phase they are expect to be rooted in. Afterwards general solutions will be present were available otherwise instance specific solutions may be presented. Some problems may not be exclusive to deep-learning and this collection might not be complete. Reasons for assembling this collection include the increased use of automated decision making or in short ADM where deep-learning is a part of. In combination with more tools been available to make it easier to develop and deploy deep-learning applications it is important that the safety, security and reliability of deep-learning gets sufficiently analysed.
