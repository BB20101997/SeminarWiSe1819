\section{Introduction}

This Paper will at first describe possible Problems when applying Deep-Learning technologies and their possible effects. The Problems will be grouped based on the development phase we expect them to be rooted in. After the Problems have been described, it will, if possible, present general solution to said Problems or otherwise it might give solutions for special cases. It shall be noted that some of these Problems also apply to software development of any kind and this paper does not claim to cover every problem and solution.
